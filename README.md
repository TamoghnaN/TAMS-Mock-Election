# Thanks for coming to see TAMS's democracy!

## How to use all the files:

ElectionResults.csv is the data containing all 115 ballots of TAMS. It contains the wing and election data.

It is then read into Election.R, where the analysis takes place. If you're a Python nerd, then you can use Election.py (I am inclusive, don't worry). All the comments for extending the analysis to the smaller elections are on Election.R, but matching it to the other file should not be a problem; if it is, [message me on Insta](https://www.instagram.com/archithsharma/) or [send me an email](mailto:archithsharma@gmail.com), or create an issue or pull request.

All of it is reported in [the election results document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Uf32Wjb6Pf_qdHiJjc_qd6M4t1_LFoI/view?usp=sharing). You're free to use this code/data however you want, but if you do something cool, tell me!
